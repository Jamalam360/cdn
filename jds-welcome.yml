      Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism or hate speech will be tolerated.

    Do Not Spam: >
      No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.

      No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence or other disturbing graphic content.

    Do Not Scam: >
      Do not share any scam links, IP grabbers, etc.

    Use English: >
      Use English - we are not able to moderate other languages.

      If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!

    Respect Moderators: >
      Moderators have the final say on what is against the rules - we can't put _everything_ in the rules. Respect their decision, and if you think they are abusing their power, contact another moderator via DMs.
